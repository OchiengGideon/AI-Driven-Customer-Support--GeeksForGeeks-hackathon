# AI-Driven Customer Support Solution

## 📌 Project Overview
In modern enterprises, delivering efficient and high-quality customer support is a critical challenge. As businesses scale, customer queries increase in volume and complexity, requiring rapid and accurate resolution. However, customer support teams often struggle with:

- **Delays in response times**
- **Inconsistent resolutions**
- **Inefficient routing of tasks**

To address these challenges, this project introduces an **AI-driven multi-agent system** designed to streamline customer support operations by automating key processes such as:

- **Conversation summarization**
- **Actionable insight extraction**
- **Resolution recommendation based on historical data**
- **Efficient task routing**
- **Resolution time estimation and optimization**

## 🚀 Solution Approach
Our multi-agent AI system leverages natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and automation to enhance efficiency, reduce human workload, and improve customer satisfaction. The system consists of multiple specialized AI agents, each handling a specific aspect of the support workflow.

## 🔎 Current Process and Challenges
### 1️⃣ **Summary Generation & Action Extraction**
**Current Process:**
- Support agents manually review and summarize customer queries.
- Key points and action items (e.g., escalations, follow-ups) are identified and recorded in the ticketing system.

**Challenges:**
- Time-consuming manual summarization.
- Missed or inaccurate action items.
- Lack of standardized format for summaries.

### 2️⃣ **Routing Actions for Other Teams**
**Current Process:**
- Manual ticket assignments based on agent judgment and predefined rules.
- Escalations handled via emails or internal tools, often causing delays.
- Misrouted tasks require reassignments, extending resolution time.

**Challenges:**
- Dependency on human decisions introduces errors and inefficiencies.
- Poor coordination between support, technical, and business teams.
- No dynamic workload balancing based on ticket complexity.

### 3️⃣ **Resolution Recommendation through Historical Data**
**Current Process:**
- Agents manually search past tickets and knowledge bases.
- Solutions are recommended based on personal experience or documentation.
- Unresolved issues are escalated without structured insights.

**Challenges:**
- Inconsistent resolution quality.
- Lack of a structured, AI-powered knowledge retrieval system.
- Limited ability to learn from past successful resolutions.

### 4️⃣ **Resolution Time Estimation and Minimization**
**Current Process:**
- Agents estimate resolution time based on personal experience.
- SLA-based prioritization lacks predictive capabilities.
- No predictive analytics to anticipate delays or optimize workflows.

**Challenges:**
- Inefficient prioritization leading to bottlenecks.
- Unpredictable resolution times causing customer dissatisfaction.
- No real-time tracking and optimization of ticket lifecycles.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The solution consists of the following AI-driven components:

1. **Summarization & Action Extraction Agent:** Uses NLP to analyze customer conversations and extract key points and action items.
2. **Task Routing Agent:** Automatically assigns tickets to the right teams based on content analysis, workload distribution, and past resolution patterns.
3. **Resolution Recommendation Agent:** Leverages historical ticket data and knowledge bases to suggest solutions for similar queries.
4. **Resolution Time Estimation Agent:** Predicts ticket resolution time using ML models trained on past support interactions and SLAs.
5. **Automation & Workflow Optimization Engine:** Streamlines ticket processing by integrating with ticketing systems and providing real-time insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **FastAPI** - For building scalable, high-performance APIs.
- **Ollama** - For text processing and intelligent NLP-based summarization.
- **SQLite** - For lightweight and efficient storage of interactions.
- **Machine Learning Models (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)** - For classification, recommendation, and predictive analytics.
- **Web Scraper** - To learn from FAQs and knowledge bases.
